# Flutter-Portfolio-App
I successfully developed my first portfolio app using Flutter, integrating a splash screen and all essential details. This project highlights my ability to create user-friendly mobile applications while demonstrating my growing skills in app development. It marks the beginning of my journey into mobile and Flutter-based projects.
